## Introduction

This repository is a list of awesome resources for Epitech students. It is meant to be a place where you can find a lot of useful links to help you during your studies made by Epitech students for Epitech students. 

It's in any way a place to rank repositories. I don't have the power to know which repository is better. This is why you may find a lot of repositories from the same person.

## Contributing

You must minimize words to describe your addition by avoiding repeating words.

For exemple, if you want to add a tool to help you with your shell, you must not write "Shell" in the description of your tool. Instead, you must put it in the correct category and you may write "Shell" in the name of your tool.

Avoid subjective term if possible, and if there's explain what it is about.

For tools, you must add a link to the official repository. If you want to add a anything, please follow the following template:

```markdown

- [Addition Name](link) - Description of the addition.

```

Every repositories must have a comprehensive README.md file with a description of the project. It must describe the project and its usage, and it may have images.
They may be some exception to this rule, but it will be decided on a case by case basis.

If not followed, your pull request will be rejected.
